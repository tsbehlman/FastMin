Overview
=======

A collection of speedy minifiers written in PHP with linear space and time complexity for HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.

This library is inspired by Jonathan Walsh's [CSSFastMin](http://git.io/FX_L3w), of which my version is a port to PHP with some added features to improve minification.
